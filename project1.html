                    <strong>Design Brief: Keep in Touch</strong> </br>
                    The World Health Organisation includes the ability of an individual to 
                    cope with the normal stresses of life as one part of mental health (World 
                    Health Organisation, 2018). The COVID-19 pandemic has placed stresses on 
                    people beyond what is normal, in particular those who are in high-risk 
                    groups, including older adults (Armitage and Nellums, 2020; Mesa Vieira 
                    et al., 2020). 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In the absence of an effective clinical treatment and lower 
                    levels  of  vaccinations  than  would  allow  risk-free  movement  in  the 
                    community, it has been necessary to socially engineer a response to protect 
                    those  who  have  a  high  relative  risk  in  relation  to  COVID-19  including 
                    maintaining  physical  distance  to  reduce  the  spread  of  the  virus.  This 
                    response  to  COVID-19  places  a  specific  stress  on  the  mental  health  of 
                    people who isolate themselves physically, which often means that they are 
                    also socially isolated. Social isolation is a serious problem for older 
                    adults, and the burden of isolation has been highlighted as a source of 
                    additional stress for older adults due to COVID-19.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    You are tasked with developing a concept for KiT, a communications 
                    appliance that helps older adults who have lower technological literacy, 
                    and other accessibility issues, such as a physical impairment, keep in 
                    touch with loved ones, carers and clinicians (such as a GP).
                    Your  team  will  iteratively  design  and  develop  a  functional  interactive 
                    prototype which:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Engages with the specific needs of the target users on an issue that 
                        affects them</li>
                      <li>Is accessible and empowers individual users</li>
                      <li>Responds to the brief</li>  
                    </ul>
                    
                  
                  </p>

                <p class="lead">The FamilySim Magic Mirror was developed to address a lack of social connection
                   particularly for the elderly by providing them with a device which is unintrusive
                    and can naturally integrate into their daily lives (as a mirror is a device which
                     is walked past daily).</p>
                <p>
                  The Keeping in Touch brief demonstrates the struggle for the elderly to communicate with one another during the COVID-19 pandemic. This social isolation can lead to a variety of detrimental effects. 
                </br></br>
For the elderly, the risk of cognitive decline increases severely when social connections and activity are limited (Nicholson, 2012). Through the COVID-19 pandemic, the popularity of applications such as like Zoom have surged as methods for keeping in touch with friends and family in the absence of physical interactions. However for older adults their needs and wants are often neglected when it comes to developing new technologies (Pedell et al, 2013).
</br></br>
The problem brief highlights social isolation as a problem especially for the elderly living in times such as the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Varioius online online tools have popularised as a result of the social and geographical isolation caused however according to our primary research, many of these tools are difficult to use among the elderly and therefore not utilised by them. This emphasies the need for an elderly-friendly online tool to promote communication to address the lack of social interaction.

                            <strong>Home</strong> </br>
                            The MagicMirror Family Sim has 3 main capabilities, most of which is centred around 
                      scheduling and contacting specific family members and loved ones. The experience is personalised around the 
                      users based on the interactions they make using this device.
                          </p>
        
                          <p>Users can interact with their family members through the home screen in three distinct ways:
                          </p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>Making an impromptu call</li>
                            <li>Checking their calendar, and scheduling a call</li>
                            <li>Sending them a message (via voice or text)</li>
                          </ol>
                          <p><strong>Calling another user</strong></br>The process of calling another user emulates 
                            the process as it exists on a mobile device, pressing the call button and being presented 
                            with the same functions as if you were on FaceTime etc. Here a user can toggle their 
                            camera and their microphone.</br></br>
                            MagicMirror aids in facilitating conversation between family by providing "prompts" 
                            that display different questions or topics that users can answer to aid in the flow of 
                            conversation. These call prompts take up the middle of the screen and provide suggestions 
                            of conversation topics should the conversation die down.
                          </br></br>
                            The post-call rating system is similar to similar modern call applications but conveys the 
                            quality of the conversation rather than the quality of the technical experience. A user is 
                            presented with 5 reactions, which can be used to simply describe their experience in their 
                            call with this person. </br></br>
                            This information contributes to the visualised mood value of users' avatars, depicting if the
                             relationship between the user and the caller has been improved, maintained, or worsened.
                            </br></br>
                            <img class="emoticons" src="sunny.png">
                             When positive interactions are recorded, sunny, happy weather is displayed
                            </br></br>
                            <img class="emoticons" src="rain.png">
                            When negative interactions (or a period of time occurs without positive interaction), gloomier 
                            stormy weather displays).
                          </p>
                          <p><strong>Checking Another User's Calendar</strong></br>A user’s calendar can be viewed when the 
                            connected user has permitted you to look at it in their own privacy settings. From here a user 
                            can view when their connected user may be busy, and also schedule a time for them to call. The 
                            main purpose of this page is to allow for users to find a time when they and their connected user 
                            is free, so that they can set a time to call. </br></br>
                            This is an alternative to calling out of the blue. From this page users can schedule a call by clicking 
                            on a date that is free, and interacting with the popup that confirms the specific time of the call. 
                            By scheduling a call, they will now receive notifications when the time of their call draws near.

                          </br></br>
                          <strong>Sending a Message to Another User</strong></br>
                          A user can choose from two different types of messages; a text message and a voice message, to send 
                          to their connected user. 
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Voice Messaging</strong>
                            </br>Operating the voice message section is very similar to operating applications such as Voice Memos. They simply:
                          </br> <ol>
                            <li>Press the mic button to record</li>
                            <li>Press the green button to send the message</li>
                            <li>View message success popup</li>
                          </ol>
                            </li>

                  Using a suite of UX design methods, we explored our areas of interest in the brief, refined
